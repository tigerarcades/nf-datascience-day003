    "Throughout this entire notebook you should be experimenting with the code in the non-text cells. A great way to begin to get a feel for Python is by playing with it. So, have some fun by changing the values in the cells and then running them again with Shift-Enter. \n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of each section there will be some questions to help further your understanding. Remember, in Python we always can manually test things by trying them out; however, you should try to think about the answers to these questions before you run some code. This way you can check and verify your understanding of the section's topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Logic\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have a thorough understanding of base numeric types and how to play with and store them in Python, let's keep building our tools so that we can use them to control the flow of our programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest way to control the flow of your Python program is with an `if` statement. From a high level, an `if` statement allows us to check whether or not a certain condition is true. If it is, certain operations will be performed. Otherwise, those operations will not be executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, say we're asked to write a program that takes a bunch of numbers and gives back to us those that are even. We would need to write an `if` statement that identifies whether or not a number is even (we'll talk later about how to do this), and then give back only those that meet the even condition. This is a program that will be entirely within our ability to implement at the end of next week; for now, though, let's focus on the `if` statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general syntax of an `if` statement in Python is:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if condition:\n",
    "    if_block_statement\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice how the `if` statement, after the condition, ends in a colon `:`. This is the way that Python declares the start of an indentation block. The purposes of indentation blocks manifest themselves in many different ways. With our `if` statement, just know that they mark a section of code that is run under specific circumstances, when the codition is true. What does it mean, then, for a condition to be true? To understand this, let's look at conditionals.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conditionals\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's tackle this one part at a time. What does it mean to be a condition? Really, all an `if` is checking is whether the conditional evaluates to `True` or `False`. In english, it checks if the condition is true or not. If the condition is true, then the body of the `if` statement is executed. If the condition is false, the `if` block is skipped. Intuitively, true and false are concepts that make perfect sense to us. But, we should take the time to clearly define them in a programming context.\n",
    "\n",
    "`True` and `False` are what we call booleans in logic, and what Python calls them (`bool` for short). They are a special variable type with many potential uses; mainly they are used as a way to put a label on the truth of a statement. There are two specifically reserved words for bools in Python, `True` and `False`. Note that these begin with capital letters."

The `else` is similar, but it doesn't accept a condition. Instead, it mainly acts as a catch all for any other situation that you didn't cover with your `if`s and `elif`s.
