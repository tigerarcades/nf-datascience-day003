    "Throughout this entire notebook you should be experimenting with the code in the non-text cells. A great way to begin to get a feel for Python is by playing with it. So, have some fun by changing the values in the cells and then running them again with Shift-Enter. \n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of each section there will be some questions to help further your understanding. Remember, in Python we always can manually test things by trying them out; however, you should try to think about the answers to these questions before you run some code. This way, you can check and verify your understanding of the section's topic.\n",

    "## Looping\n",
    "\n",
    "We are now prepared to learn about another extremely powerful programming construct. Everything that we learned in the last section on logic is part of an idea called **control flow**. Flow refers to the order in which statements in your program are executed. Controlling this flow can be done in many ways; so far we have learned about `if`-`elif`-`else` statements, but there are a number of others.\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing that we find in programming is that we want to do something over and over (and over), possibly under the same circumstances each time, but frequently under slightly different circumstances each time. With the tools that we currently possess, we have to write out a line of Python for each time that we want to do that something. Let's go through a more concrete example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider that you are asked to write a program to calculate the sum of the numbers between 1 and 8 (without the use of any built-in Python functions). We could write an extremely simple line of code to do this for us."

    "While this works, there are a couple of things I want to draw your attention to. These will become themes about how to analyze how well code is written. What happens if we want to add some other numbers together, perhaps the numbers 1 through 9, and use the code above to help? It's not that hard - just add 9 to `sum_1_8`, you say. After all, we're already most of the way there. Ok, fine. What if you want to add 2 through 9 together? Now we could take `sum_1_8`, add 9 and subtract off 1. That works, but it involves some thinking to make this new idea work with the existing code that we have written.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of having all of these **hard coded** values in our definition of `sum_1_8`, we could instead **abstract** away part of our problem. What is this abstraction? In programming, we talk about abstraction when we want to refer to an idea whose implementation is more general and/or hidden from us. In the above example, we see exactly what we're doing to sum the numbers 1 through 8. This isn't abstracted at all. So, how are we to solve this problem more abstractly?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a question that you will frequently be faced with; how do you do something... in code? A good strategy to solve these problems is to approach the problem from a high level (i.e. in plain English, no code).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's do that with our coding problem above. We were asked to add together the numbers 1 through 8. This can be thought of as given a starting number, 1, and then adding on the next number, 2, to get 3. Then, we can repeat this process, taking the next number, 3, and adding it on, giving us 6. We could then continue this process until we reach the final number, 8, and then stop. This is inherently what we were doing in that single line of Python when we said `1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8`, but that implementation is what we call **brittle** - it only works for that specific case and breaks whenever we want to do something even slightly different.\n",

    "### While Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that in our high level description of the problem solution, we kept saying \"and then\". This repetitious language brings us to our next control flow tool, loops. There are two types of loops in Python, but today we're going to focus on `while` loops. `while` loops are an amazing tool which simply allow us to have a predefined chunk of code which we tell Python we want to run over and over under certain conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, what are these conditions? They are in fact the conditions we learned about in the logic section (i.e. any expression that is evaluated to a boolean). How does this work with `while`? Let's take a look at the structure of a `while` statement.\n",

    "```python\n",
    "while condition:\n",
    "    while_block_statement\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As with  `if`, a `while` statement has a condition; unlike the `if`, the while block will execute over and over again as long as the condition is `True` (the `if` block executes **only once**). This is where we get the name `while` loop from - **while** the condition evaluates to `True`, we will execute the code inside the `while` block, looping over it. The `while` condition is checked each time before the `while` statement block is executed. Take a look at this idea depicted in a flow diagram.\n",
